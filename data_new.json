The rice and tomatoes can be sub'd out with different ethnicities and flavors, this recipe is very versatile and my personal favorite.  If you need low sodium then get the low sodium versions of rice and tomatoes.  Makes 4 hearty bowls that will fill you up, or if you're a light weight more like 6-7, lol.  Serve and enjoy!",

Size names, such as \u0093large\u0094 or \u0093extra large,\u0094 are not standardized, so to be sure you're getting the size you want, order by the count (or number) per pound. Both wild-caught and farm-raised shrimp can damage the surrounding ecosystems when not managed properly. Fortunately, it is possible to buy shrimp that have been raised or caught with sound environmental practices. Look for fresh or frozen shrimp certified by an independent agency, such as Wild American Shrimp or Marine Stewardship Council. If you can't find certified shrimp, choose wild-caught shrimp from North America\u0097it's more likely to be sustainably caught.",
         "Kitchen Tip: It's best to use a grill basket when grilling small shrimp so they don't fall into the fire. If you don't have one, fold a 24-inch-long piece of heavy-duty foil in half and crimp up the edges to create a lip; this \"basket\" will prevent the shrimp from sliding off.",

         "1. To make the batter, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and dashi powder in a bowl. Make a hole in the center. Whisk together the egg and water, then whisk into the dry ingredients to form a smooth batter. Transfer to a measuring cup. Set aside to bloom for at least 15 minutes, or cover with plastic and leave at room temperature for as long as 2 hours.",
         "2. Have the filling ingredients ready near the stove, along with the batter. Make sure the garnishes are ready too as the dumplings are best eaten hot from the pan.",
         "3. Heat the pancake puff, aebelskiver, or takoyaki pan over medium heat. Brush a light coating of oil in each well. Aim for a moderately warm pan as if you\u0092re making pancakes. Too hot of pan will form craters on the surface and you want a smooth finish on these dumplings.",
         "When the pan is sufficiently hot, pour batter into the pan to just shy of the rim. If your burner has hot spots, fill the wells above those hot spots last. If anything, there should be just a light sizzle when the batter hits the pan. Lower the heat if the sizzling is loud as that\u0092s a sign that the pan is too hot.",
         "4. Add 1 or 2 pieces of octopus and generous pinches of scallion, ginger, and cabbage to each well. The batter level will rise a tad. Then wait for about 1 minute until the edges have begun to set or small bubbles have formed at the rim. When that happens, use two skewers to loosen each dumpling around the top edge and flip it over. Expect the dumplings to be pale in color at this stage.",
         "Don\u0092t fret about doing it neatly. Aim to flip it over when there\u0092s still enough loose batter to form a round underside; some may look like Pacman but that\u0092s fine. After about 1 minute, the batter should have set on the other side and you can tuck the dumpling into the well to cook evenly into a nice round shape.",
         "Keep turning and rotating the dumpling for about 5 minutes, until the dumplings are golden and crisp. Use the skewers to transfer (stab the dumpling if you must) the dumplings to a plate. Let cool for about 1 minute before serving. Meanwhile, oil and repeat the cooking to make more takoyaki dumplings.",
         "5. To serve, drizzle the tonkatsu sauce and mayonnaise atop the dumplings. Follow by sprinkling with seaweed and finish with the bonito flakes. Eat with forks or skewers, should you want to mimic the act of eating takoyaki on the street.",

Immediately put eggs in super cold water then wait 7 to 8 minutes. ..take eggs from ice bath into medium warm water and begin to peel eggs start at wider end..the flatter end.. They should peel easily...don't dry eggs before peeling...they seem to peel easier when wet.. Cut lengthwise and rinse white clean and set upside down on paper towels to drain...set yolks aside  Filling Combine the following in a gallon size zip lock bag or piping bag. Spiced Apple cider vinegar I threw together pickling spices and 2 table spoons of cider vinegar, popped them in the microwave for 30 sec...let it set for 15 minutes strained, added sweetener and add to yolks.. (In this case I was trying something new so I prepared it as I was making the eggs but I think I will prepare spiced vinegar to have on hand because I really liked the taste.)  You can used pickle juice or skip the juice but our family likes it better  Because the hubby is diabetic I used splenda/ stevia instead of sugar.  To yolks and vinegar add  Miracle Whip..or mayo of choice Yello mustard of choice  Close up ziploc bag and knead the ingredients until creamy and smooth.  Cut corner of of ziploc bag..not too much of the corner! Then pip the filling into waiting eggs.  You can sprinkle the eggs with paprika or smoked paprika crumbled dried basil or parsley  Sometimes we add pickle relish to half the mixture for a change and only decorate the relish free eggs with paprika to identify each..hubby doesn't like relish   Chill in fridge for 15 to 30 minutes..  Enjoy....I always take one for testing before I set them out...and to make sure I get one before they are gone..:)  Serving Size: Makes 18 to 24 deviled eggs",
